# Project FinanSP
FinanSP is a project aimed at studying the use of Apache Spark (dataframes, machine learning, structured streaming) to an application related to finance. The main development tool is PySpark.

## Project goals
The primary goals of the project are:

* Analyze websites that supply financial data to determine what information is available for free through an API.
* Develop dataframes-based PySpark applications to get simple statistical data (mean, median, statistical deviation, max, min, etc.) of the stock information of some selected companies.
* Design a study to predict the stock market price of a company using machine learning techniques.
* Apply clustering algorithms to a group of companies.
* Develop a streaming application that gathers information from one or more data sources.
* Use of GitHub features: version control, wiki, project, pull request.

## Project development
The project will be develop in three iterations:

* Iteration 1 (one week): Web site data analysis, data adquisition, simple statistical processing.
* Iteration 2 (two weeks): Data wrangling, development of prototypes with simulated data.
* Iteration 3 (two weeks): Development of the prediction, clustering, and streaming applications with real data.
* Final reports: Summary of the conducted work.
