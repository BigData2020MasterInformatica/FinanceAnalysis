# Project FinanSP
FinanSP is a project aimed at studying the use of Apache Spark (dataframes, machine learning, structured streaming) to an application related to finance. The project is developed using PySpark.

## Project goals
The primary goals of the project are:

* Analyze websites that supply financial data to determine what information is available for free through an API.
* Develop dataframes-based PySpark applications to get simple statistical data (mean, median, statistical deviation, max, min, etc.) of the stock information of some selected companies.
* Design a study to predict the stock market price of a company using machine learning techniques.
* Apply clustering algorithms to a group of companies.
* Develop a streaming application that gathers information from one or more data sources.
